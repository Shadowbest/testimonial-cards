            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
            if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

            "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make
            a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed
            up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
            startup."

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance
            from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

            "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
            The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and

            will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I neede some structure
            from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
            to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
            and I never had to wait long for assistance The agile team project, in particular,
            was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could
            ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
            development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
            after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
